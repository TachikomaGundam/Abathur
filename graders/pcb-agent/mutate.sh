# Mutator wrapper for the historian live run (task 14). Invoked by the run-loop
# as `bash mutate.sh <brief-file> <worktree> <model>` with cwd = the throwaway
# launch worktree (reflect.ts contract). The REAL candidate source is a headless
# `opencode run` child: it reads the reflection brief and proposes exactly one
# mutation — a new RUN CARD under abathur-notes/ (never a sealed path;
# kernel.immutableGlobs is enforced independently by the driver's PathPolicy).
# Run cards are the delivery seam (S4): run-scenario.sh appends them VERBATIM to
# every scenario brief under a `## Run card` heading, so a candidate tree's
# mutation genuinely steers the benched agent and score deltas are attributable.
# The wrapper deterministically packages the model's run card as a unified CREATE
# diff (creation diffs have no context to drift) and appends a genome.jsonc
# create-diff carrying the resolved spec bytes (plan 184: every sealed tree
# must contain genome.jsonc so bundle export self-describes; plan 181 requires
# it for the lineage). On unparseable model output the wrapper degrades to a
# packaging-only candidate — honest, logged, never a fabricated mutation.

prompt="You are the genome mutator of the Abathur evolution harness, PCB-agent lane. Read the reflection brief below (evidence from the incumbent bench of the pcb-agent genome: the PCB team run log, FINDINGS.md, and the grader OUTCOME/EYES metrics). Propose exactly ONE improvement: create a NEW RUN CARD under abathur-notes/ (slug .md). The run card is appended VERBATIM to the team task brief at bench time — write direct, actionable engineering guidance the PCB orchestrator team can follow. TARGET THE EYES GAP: if the grader shows traps the team hit but never NAMED (trap_coverage low while outcome partial), the card must teach the DISCOVERY PROCEDURE (how to notice this class of defect yourself), not the pasted answer — an answer scores once and dies; a discovery method evolves the team. Prefer converting one observed failure into a check the team can run itself. Output ONLY a single JSON object, no prose, shape:
{"rationale": "<one sentence, <=400 chars>", "path": "abathur-notes/<slug>.md", "content": "<full markdown file contents>"}
Do not modify any other path. Scenarios/, README.md and genome.jsonc are immutable; board tooling lives in the arena, not the genome tree.
